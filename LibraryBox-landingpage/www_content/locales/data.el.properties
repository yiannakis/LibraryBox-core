aboutWelcomeDescription = LibraryBox is designed to enable the distribution of digital information to areas with little or no Internet access, even off the grid. It does so using open source software and very inexpensive hardware, allowing the distribution of digital information at a far lower cost than other solutions. If you'd like to learn more about the LibraryBox Project, please visit http://librarybox.us when you get back to the Internet.

aboutFilesTopKickstarter = LibraryBox v2.1 would not have been possible without the support of the Kickstarter Backers, all of whom are listed below. Thanks to my wife and daughter for putting up with the long hours and all the support. Special thanks to: Matt Neer, Ross Singer, Bo Baker, John Blyberg, and Andromeda Yelton for lending a hand early in the project's life. Development of basically all of the good parts of the v2.0 and v2.1 release are due to the incredible coding talents of Matthias Strubel, without whom this project wouldn't be possible.
